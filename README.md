# PasswordEntryDemo
 Xamarin.Android demo project for entry and validation of passwords.
 
 This was a coding challenge issued by an organization to demonstrate Xamarin.Android knowledge. (I also happen to know Xamarin Forms but that was not required for this challenge).
 
 The app simply allows users to enter a user name and a password. The password must meet specific criteria, and regular expressions are used to evaluate entry against such criteria.
 
 The app also keeps a local SQLite database, and makes insertions for valid entries.
 
 There's not much else to this project other than to present a very simple base upon which an Android application can be built, using C# instead of Java or Kotlin.
